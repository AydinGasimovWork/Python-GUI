## Visual Neural Network Builder

This program uses Python's GUI toolkit - **Tkinter** along with open source machine learning library - **Keras**  to help a user build a simple neural network. 

### How to run
1. Open a Terminal that has Python3.10 or similar version installed
2. Type either `py run.py` or `Python3 run.py` in the terminal.
 > Note that more than likely Python will have to build the necessary cache before the program can run successfully

### May give error if not already installed
- Pandas
- Tensorflow
- Matplotlib
 
 ### How to use
 - When starting, the user will immediately be placed in a page where they can build a neural network
 - After building the network, user can jump to different sections that involve using training a model and testing it
 - Generic Iris dataset from the university is included for a user to test
 - After loading the appropriate segments, one can train the model
 - There's a button to obtain the graph for change in accuracy and loss over time
 - There's a reset button which allows the user to start over at top left
